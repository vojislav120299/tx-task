# Introduction
Hello, this is my task. I think I fulfilled what was required in the task. The global state was done in the 'ngrx' way and I additionally used the ngrx component store for the needs of the invoice component purely for display. As for the unit tests, I didn't have time to write for all the components, so I wrote for the key components: job-ad-list and create-edit-job-ad. Server side is done using json-server. In server.js there is a small logic for getting and writing data in db.json.
